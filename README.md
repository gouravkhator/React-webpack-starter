# A starter pack for creating React Web Apps
It has hot reload functionality.

Unlike create-react-app which contains many clutters in the starter, this starter pack provides minimal pack to start with.

Install dependencies by :

npm i

Start the dev server by :

npm run start

And create the production build by :

npm run build
